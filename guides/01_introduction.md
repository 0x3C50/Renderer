# Rendering
"the process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from input data such as 3D models."

Minecraft does rendering, and you can too. That's what this library is all about. While Minecraft exposes some rendering things themselves,
some more advanced things are lacking, and that is what this library aims to solve. This library provides some common code for rendering
things in the world, on the hud, and utilities for facilitating that.

## Prerequisites
This library is aimed towards people, who already worked with rendering to some extent. You should know what happens
when you tell OpenGL to draw a rectangle.
